# ideo-quest
A quest into learning about ideology

# History
This is a really ancient project, the first real personal project I worked on. My first project I posted to GitHub was called 'turn-octo-robot', and I didn't really know what I was doing. 

The project 'ideo-quest' inspred 'evgroio' this alpha project for _Logro_. A grails based application, ideo-quest should really only be used as a reference. Although it would be useful as a way to do a political quiz, it is very unscientific. I'm happy with some of the interesting data visualizations, as well.

# Lessons Learned
* Making software can be very challenging
* A tech stack is a important notion for a programming newcomer to understand. In this app, I used grails/groovy, javascript, and MySQL.
* I wouldn't do much different with where I was in my life at the time. My job surrounded me with Java programmers, and I was able to ask for tips about Java when I was a junior developer. I've learned that asking for help can be more than useful.
* I found that doing a project improves one's abilities, and I got a better grasp of how to build software because I gave it a shot.
* I think that I could go back and improve this software, but I'm not sure I would deploy it in the state it's in.
* I could easily salvage quite a bit of the front-end code, but I might just rewrite the back-end into another language (2016)
* In my belief, Scala is a nicer Java based language - it works well with Hadoop as well. The back-end could also be rewritten into some python based language.
* Unknown unknowns are a thing, and not knowing was my greatest weakness with this project. Ah, look how far things have come.
